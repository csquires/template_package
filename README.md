This repository is a template for the development of Python packages, hosted on [PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

The best practices for package development include:
* **Documentation**: I prefer [numpy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstrings, generated using [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html), and hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) (RTD). The documentation is generated by running the command `make html` in the `sphinx_docs/` directory, and you can set up Github integrations so that the documentation on RTD is updated whenever you commit new documentation.
* **Testing with Continuous Integration**: I use the `unittests` package: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html.
I also use [Travis](https://travis-ci.com) for continuous integration.
* **Code coverage**: This shows how much of your code is actually run by your tests; I use [codecov.io](https://about.codecov.io/)

The below section shows what you'd actually put in the README.
